# GiphyAPICalling

This app allows you to control animated gifs (start/stop animation).

First, select a category, and it will select the 10 most popular gifs with that category from the GIPHY website.

You can add new categories of your own. If you enter same string twice, it'll tell you can't addd that category as it's been already added. But if no such category has been added, then a button with that category will be added.

Each gif can be animated by clicking on the picture.

This is how the app looks! You can click here https://prasengope.github.io/GiphyAPICalling/ to play with it.
Have fun!
